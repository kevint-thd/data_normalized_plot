# data_normalized_plot

I have updated the graphs as you  explained
I tried different intervals for data, it contained one month of data, i took 4 day intervals in axis ,
the second approach  I took a mean of every minute in an hour for every hour
I have plotted as my knowledge, One graph/plot looks good
