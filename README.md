Hello User, I have plotted the graph as suggested; initially, on Dec  1, 2023,  I updated the graph using the normalization method. I have also used different techniques to optimize.

""" criteria used: Standardization centers data around a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, while normalization scales data to a set range, often [0, 1], by using the minimum and maximum values"

Dec 2 - graphs  ( graphs towards bottom ), I have updated  standardization methods; As suggested updated with density and box plot. Removed unwanted graphs. I have included different graphs to select to get a better insight . Kindly check and go from top to bottom.
